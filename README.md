# Reflective-Practise



## Description – What happened?

* The course included hands-on projects, live sessions, and networking opportunities. 
* Initially, I struggled with some coding syntax concepts but gradually improved by immersing myself in more projects and group work tasks.

## Feelings – What were you thinking and feeling?
* At first, I felt excited but also nervous because I had limited experience with Python. 
* During the course, I sometimes felt overwhelmed by the pace and the terminology used in the syntax code.

## Evaluation – What was good and bad about the experience?
  
Positive aspects:
* Dan Petrusow, my trainer, was very helpful and was quick to respond when I needed help, and I connected with peers who had similar goals.

Negative aspects:
* The workload was intense, making it hard to balance with other commitments.
Some topics, like machine learning and AI, felt rushed due to time constraints.

## Analysis – What sense can you make of the situation?

* The structured curriculum and hands-on projects were beneficial, but I realized I needed to manage my time better. 
* I also learned that asking questions early could have helped me grasp concepts faster.

## Conclusion – What else could you have done?

* I could have planned my schedule better and engaged more in discussions.
* Watching supplementary tutorials might have helped reinforce difficult concepts 

## Action Plan – If it happened again, what would you do?

* Set aside dedicated study time and actively get more feedback on projects from the tutor.
* Work on additional projects to reinforce learning during my bootcamp and after the bootcamp is finished.
